The answer will make the user question how does it know? The reverse fortune statement should also be a little dark and humorous at the same time but no racism or sexism or religious jokes. Make the reverse fortune statement very personal to the user's (past love life or age or relationship with others or primary education or sports), so that, the user can relate to it.
